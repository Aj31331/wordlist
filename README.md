# Wordlists
Shared wordlists used for subdomain, files and directory bruteforcing etc.

## Unique Wordlists, tailor-made, optimized and fine-tuned.
* Merged with https://github.com/the-xentropy/samlists to order wordlists based on probability/likelihood
* Smaller lists can be used against rate limiting / WAF
* Wordlists are included in automated recon / scan scripts:
* https://github.com/onvio/recon/blob/main/ffuf.sh
* https://github.com/onvio/recon/blob/main/subrecon.sh
* Use Assetnote for bigger wordlists if needed: https://wordlists.assetnote.io/
